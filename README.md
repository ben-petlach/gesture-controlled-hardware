# ‚úã Hand Gesture Recognition and Device Control

A Java application that uses computer vision to detect hand gestures for controlling Arduino components. The system features a camera-based interface that recognizes finger counts and hand movements to interact with various devices.

## üöÄ Features

- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Recognizes the number of fingers shown to select different devices
- **Device Control**: Controls LED brightness, servo motor position, and buzzer volume using hand height gestures
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual display of recognized gestures and device control values
- **Hardware Integration**: Seamless communication with Arduino using the Firmata protocol

---

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (compatible with Firmata)
- Webcam or built-in camera
- LED connected to pin 3
- Servo motor connected to pin 9
- Buzzer connected to pin 5
- Reset button connected to pin 6

**Example Setup:**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Connect your Arduino board and upload the `StandardFirmata` sketch
2. Update the `PORT` constant in `Main.java` to match your Arduino's serial port
3. Compile and run the application
4. Place your hand in the yellow box shown on the screen  
   ![Default UI](imgs/default_ui.png)
5. Show **1, 2, or 3 fingers** to select LED, servo, or buzzer respectively
6. Move your hand up and down to control the selected device
7. Press the reset button to return to device selection mode

## üîÑ Interaction Flow

- **Finger counting mode**:  
  Show fingers to select a device
    - 1 for LED
    - 2 for Servo
    - 3 for Buzzer

      ![Closed Fist](imgs/closed_fist_ui.png)

- **Distance measurement mode**:  
  After selecting a device, the vertical height of your hand controls the device value
    - Higher = more brightness/volume/position

- **Reset**:  
  Press the physical button to return to finger counting mode
